# 🚨 Nagar Alert Hub

A real-time civic engagement platform that closes the loop between citizens and government departments.

### 🎯 Problem Statement Alignment
This project directly tackles the **"Inclusive Society & Digital Trust"** problem statement. Current municipal reporting systems feel like black holes—citizens report issues but never see action, destroying civic trust. **Nagar Alert Hub** rebuilds this trust through extreme transparency: live visual maps, AI-powered immediate triage, and a transparent feedback loop where citizens can track their exact complaint from "Pending" to "Resolved". 

### 💻 Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database
* **AI / ML:**    for instant NLP department classification (with a custom Bigram/Keyword fallback layer for 100% resilience).
* **Frontend:** Thymeleaf, TailwindCSS (Glassmorphism UI), Leaflet.js (OpenStreetMap)
* **APIs:** OpenStreetMap Nominatim for Geocoding.

### ⚙️ How It Works (in 5 Lines)
1. **Report:** A citizen spots a problem (e.g., "pipe burst") and submits a 10-second report with their location and phone number.
2. **AI Triage:** Our Groq-powered AI instantly reads the natural language, predicts the correct department (e.g., *Municipal*), and assigns a severity.
3. **Public Map:** The incident instantly drops onto the live Leaflet.js city map, proving to the community that the report was registered.
4. **Admin Action:** The Municipal admin logs into their securely filtered Spring Security dashboard, sees the new alert, and marks it "In Progress".
5. **Trust Loop:** The citizen checks `/my-alerts` using their phone number and sees their exact issue being resolved in real-time.

### 🎥 Demo Flow (For Judges)

1. **The Hook (Homepage):** Open the app. Point out the sleek **Live Map**. Explain that this is what transparency looks like.
2. **The Submission:** Click "Report Issue". Type a natural phrase: *"There is a huge fire near the bakery"* and enter phone number `9999999999`. Submit.
3. **The Magic (AI):** Show that the system automatically detected the department as **FIRE** and mapped the coordinates without manual dropdowns. 
4. **The Citizen View:** Go to "Track My Alerts" (`/my-alerts`). Enter `9999999999`. Show the issue is currently **Pending**.
5. **The Admin View:** Click Admin Login. Click on the **Fire Department**. Log in. (The system automatically filters to only show Fire emergencies).
6. **The Resolution:** Mark the fire alert as **In Progress**, then **Resolved**. 
7. **The Loop Closed:** Go back to the Citizen View to show it is now "Resolved", proving the government took action.
